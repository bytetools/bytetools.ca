## Accessible Document Transcription

We offer document transcription services for power point slides, textbooks and any other type of inaccessible document.
Our goal is to:

1. Create fully accessible documents, and
2. Get them done on a deadline.

We specialize in scientific documents (e.g., computer science, mathematics), but we work on a bit of everything.
There are three main categories of documents we transcribe:

* Slide decks and textbooks
* Web pages with many inaccessible pieces of content
* Exams

When the transcription is done, you can opt-in to receiving a text message on completion along with a link where you can download your accessible documents.
Completed files are semantic, HTML5 webpages;
this allows us to use an free, open, platform-independent standard that can be read on any computer.

[Contact us](/contact/) for examples of previously transcribed files, and to set up a meeting so we can get started on *your* documents.

## Audio Description

We offer audio description for video content of short (up to 4 minutes) to medium (5-10 minutes) lengths.
Although this service is usually a part of another (i.e., a link to a YouTube video from a slide deck), we do independent jobs as well.
Here is an example of audio description that we did on [the Piano Stairs in Sweden](#).

Please [contact us](/contact/) for a price estimate.
