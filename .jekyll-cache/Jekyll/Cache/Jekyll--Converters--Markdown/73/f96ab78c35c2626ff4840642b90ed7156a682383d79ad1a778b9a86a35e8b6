I"\<h1 id="discounts">Discounts</h1>

<p>I offer stackable discounts to people and causes I believe in.
Here are some of the most important causes I support.</p>

<ul class="gridish">
  
    <li>Open-Source &amp; Free Software</li>
  
    <li>Small Businesses</li>
  
    <li>NHCA Members</li>
  
    <li>Community Websites &amp; Services</li>
  
</ul>

<h2>Open-Source &amp; Free Software</h2>

<p>Any software built and hosted entirely in line with either the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en">GNU</a> or the <a href="https://opensource.org/docs/osd">OSI</a> guidelines will receive a 15% discount.</p>

<h2>Small Businesses</h2>

<p>This is assessed on a case-by-case basis, and usually caries a modest 15% discount.</p>

<h2>NHCA Members</h2>

<p>Anyone who is a member of the <a href="https://nhca.ca">NHCA (Northern Hills Community Association)</a> is eligible for a 10% discount.</p>

<h2>Community Websites &amp; Services</h2>

<p>Anything which broadly comes under the umbrella of community services: community gardens, book clubs and church groups are eligible for a 10% discount.</p>
